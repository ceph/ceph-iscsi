# API settings.
# The api supports a number of options that allow you to tailor it to your
# local environment. If you want to run the api under https, you will need to
# create crt/key files that are compatible for each gateway node (i.e. not
# locked to a specific node). SSL crt and key files *must* be called
# iscsi-gateway.crt and iscsi-gateway.key and placed in /etc/ceph on *each*
# gateway node. With the SSL files in place, you can use api_secure = true
# to switch to https mode.

# To support the api, the bear minimum settings are;
api_secure = false

# Additional API configuration options are as follows (defaults shown);
# api_user = admin
# api_password = admin
# api_port = 5000
# api_host = localhost
# trusted_ip_list = IP,IP

# Refer to the ceph-iscsi-config/settings module for more options
